- just individual and social learning to start (vigialnce may be having a weird effect on social learners in nn and rw)
- check the literature (for math models too)
- start by running it to match the mathematical model
- sweep a range of detection ranges
- change the number of agents (see if they learn faster and how it scales)
- try a range of predator numbers and limit the frequency with which predators can consume prey/move
- possibly modify getMooreNeighbors so agents only have to do one check
