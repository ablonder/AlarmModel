-look into how the Bayesian learner is learning (for another paper)
	-large jumps? (see difference vs. differential equations)
-redo other graphs with just nn and rw
-interaction between social learning about vigilance and foraging
	-future model of co-evolution?
-look at interactions between variables
-maybe barplots (to focus on the means)?
-get graphs out of the math model (timecourse and end)
